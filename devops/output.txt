To generate production-ready DevOps outputs for a node.js application in Python, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:
    - Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.
    - Run `docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> .` from the project directory.

2. Puš the Docker image to a registry:
    - Log in to the Docker registry using the command `docker login`.
    - Puš the Docker image to the specified registry with the tag `latest` or any other desired tag.

3. Create Helm charts and Terraform files:
    - Generate Helm charts for your application using the `helm template` command.
    - Generate Terraform files for your application using the `terraform init` and `terraform plan` commands.

4. Add necessary secret to the Helm chart:
    - Create a secret in the Helm chart directory with the name of the secret, its type (e.g. "password"), and its value.

5. Configure DevOps tools:
    - Set up Git for version control.
    - Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools like Jenkins or CircleCI.
    - Set up automatized testing using tools like Jesst or Mocha.

6. Create a production-ready DevOps pipeline:
    - Define the steps for building, pushing, and deploying the Docker image to the registry.
    - Define the steps for creating Helm charts, Terraform files, and configurating CI/CD tools.
    - Define the steps for testing and debugging your application in production.

7. Monitor and troubleshoot:
    - Use monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana to monitor your application's performance and availability.
    - Use debugging tools like gdb or lldb to debug any issues that arise during production.
