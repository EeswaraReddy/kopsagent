# KnowledgeOps Agent

KnowledgeOps Agent is a project designed to facilitate the ingestion, processing, and orchestration of knowledge from various sources such as Confluence and GitHub. It leverages FastAPI for building a RESTful API and integrates with various storage solutions for managing metadata and vector embeddings.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **src/knowledgeops/**: Contains the main application code.
  - **api/**: Defines the REST API endpoints.
  - **connectors/**: Implements source connectors for data ingestion.
  - **ingestion/**: Contains parsing logic for different data formats.
  - **storage/**: Manages vector and metadata storage.
  - **agents/**: Implements multi-agent orchestration.
  - **llm/**: Integrates with large language models.
  - **ui/**: Contains the user interface components.
  - **utils/**: Provides utility functions.

- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the application components.

- **docker/**: Includes Docker-related files for containerization.

- **charts/**: Contains Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment.

- **infra/**: Holds Terraform configurations for infrastructure management.

- **docs/**: Provides architectural documentation and other relevant information.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/knowledgeops-agent.git
   cd knowledgeops-agent
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use Poetry or pip to install the required dependencies.
   ```bash
   poetry install
   # or
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   You can run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn.
   ```bash
   uvicorn src.knowledgeops.main:app --reload
   ```

4. **Docker Setup**:
   To run the application using Docker, build the Docker image and start the containers.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`. You can interact with the various endpoints to ingest data, query information, and manage knowledge operations.
